# What is nenyoko.github.io ?
This is where the source code of my [website](https://nenyoko.github.io) is stored. And this is where it is also hosted using [github page](https://pages.github.com). The development of this web page allows me to learn the basics of web programming including HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# The site's progress
- [x] Introducing myself
- [x] A page for a discord bot (non-existent xD)
- [x] A 404 page (Because everyone knows that it's the best page of a website :3)
- [ ] A calculator
